## Megan Hayes

I'm a Tea Sommelier turned Software Developer who is excited about life and solving problems. After serveral rewarding years working in the charity sector and tea industry I have decided to take the leap into the tech industry. To me, the tech industry offers an innovative, creative and collaborative working environment where I can further my skills as a software developer and flex my problem solving muscle. The impact of technology can be immense and can make a real difference to so many people worldwide. I would love to be a part of a team that adds value to people through technology.

### I Support and Celebrate Others.

I beleive that the best teams are full of positive, empowering and empathetic people. Who you work with hugely influences your overall wellbeing at work. I strive to be a supportive, empowering, and positive team member who celebrates the successes of others and brings people together as a team. 

### I Understand and Communicate Complex Ideas. 

My dissertation was titled 'Does Consciousness Exist?' To comprehend the concept of consciousness, I approached the concept from  multiple angles using analytical thinking, diagrams, analagous stories, metaphors, innovative questioning, effective reasoning and examination of empirical evidence. While I may never truly know if consciousness exists or not, I did learn how to communicate complex ideas logically and clearly.  

### I am Proactive and Independent. 

Day to day our lives are improved by people solving problems behind the scenes. People who see a problem and instead of waiting for someone else to fix it, find a way to fix it themselves. I pride myself on being one of these people. That's why at my part-time job at The Body Shop during university I created an Ethics and Values training sylabus to inform and teach other employees. It's why I became a Pioneer member of the European Tea Society, who's mission it is to create and inspire excellence in the speciality tea community through innovation, research, education and communication. and it's why I volunteered Oxford Homeless Pathways where I ran a creative workshop. 


### I am Enthusiastic and Inquisitive 

Wanting to try new things and get stuck into a new task.
